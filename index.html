<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
My name is Leo Versteegen, and I am a departmental fellow in combinatorics at the London School of Economics and Poltical Science. In May of 2024, I defined my PhD thesis, which I wrote under the supervision of Julia Wolf at the University of Cambridge. Since then, I completed a five month LMS Early Career Research Fellowship during which I was hosted by Alexey Pokrovskiy at University College London.
